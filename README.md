# FAIR Data and Metadata Management

**Date:** TBD

**Time:** TBD

**Venue:** Bioinformatics Training Lab

**Capacity:** TBD

**Website:** The resources used in this training are – or will be – available on this GitHub Repo.

### Introduction
Massive amount of research data have been generated at icipe, especially those associated with insect vector populations and disease occurrence in a range of environments that represent decades of research and investment. These data sets are a resource that has the potential to enable better prediction of future challenges and potential solutions in response to climate change, new invasive species or new vector management strategies. Better data management practices are required for the centre to derive greater value from these data, and this has prompted the development of Research Data Management and Archiving (RDMA)Policy. If you have data, you have or should have metadata. Data is valuable but can never be reusable or verifiable when the associated metadata is missing or incomplete. Metadata means ”data about data”; they provide the context and information required to interpret and understand the data.To ensure the reusability of our research data, and ease compliance with the policy, we are organizing a two-day training on FAIR Data and Metadata Management. The training targets all researchers and students who generate data, and will focus on the need, best practices, and the tools for managing metadata. This training will set a foundation for data curation, and ultimately metaanalysis, which is one of the strategic focus areas of *icipe*. 


### Learning Objectives
To attain the core competencies, the workshop participants should be able to:
1. Understand the need for metadata management in compliance with the RDMA Policy 
2. Know the various types of metadata, as applicable to the centre
3. Describe the metadata standards and formats: Ensuring the metadata is FAIR
4. Know the various metadata management tools, and how they support research data reusability
5. Be aware of the support provided in the centre towards metadata management: resources, tools and expertise


### Learning Outcomes
From the above objectives, the workshop participant should acquire the following skills;
1. Be able to articulate the need for metadata management, and how it relates to the RDMA Policy 
2. Be clear about the metadata type they are required to collect and managed to ensure reusability of their research data
3. Be able to manage their metadata in compliance with the FAIR principles
4. Be prepared to make use of the metadata management tools
5. Be aware, and ready to take advantage,  of the support provided in the centre towards metadata management: resources, tools and expertise
